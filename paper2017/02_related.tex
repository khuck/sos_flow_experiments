There is a long history of online monitoring systems for HPC environments.
%
Exclusively system-oriented monitoring platforms are limited to serving the
needs of machine and site administrators.
%
System-oriented platforms focus narrowly on machine metrics such as bandwidth,
queue depth, resource contention, power, and thermal measurements.
%
Application-oriented platforms are often focused on single purposes such as
the aggregation of performance tool instrumentation, and lack the flexibility
to truly extend the functionality of an HPC application.

To the authors' knowledge, no application-oriented online monitoring systems
exist that are feasible for deployment to modern architectures at large scale
and can provide runtime interactivity, are programmable, and capable of
serving purposes beyond simple migration of performance metrics.
%
SOSflow makes a novel contribution by synthesizing application and system
monitoring perspectives into a holistic architecture.
%
SOSflow goes much further than merely interleaving two data sources, as it:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operates during the application runtime
    \item Allows for local and global interactivity
    \item Couples user-defined analytics with applications
    \item Automatically archives data for offline analysis
    \item Provides full-support for complex, loosely-coupled,
        multi-component scientific workflows, as well as simple
        single-binary applications        
    \item Enables online query and feedback to both applications
        and their execution environment
    \item Is engineered to scale from single-node deployments
        to future-scale clusters
\end{itemize}
%
SOSflow is a fully-programmable system designed to be tailored to individual
use-cases with a minimuim amount of additional development or effort.
