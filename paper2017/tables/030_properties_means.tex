\begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\linewidth}|p{0.6\linewidth}|}
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Scalable}
&
From one to many thousands of nodes
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Portable}
&
Many architectures and operating systems
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Easy To Use}
& 
Simple well-degined interfaces, minimal external software dependencies
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Multi-Purpose}
&
Utility not limited to any single component purpose, does not impose
a priori purposes for monitoring
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Concurrent With Workflow}
&
Runs at the same time as workflow in order to capture emergent
behavior
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{In Situ Access}
&
Complete feature set available on-node, allowing distributed and
data-local analytics, feedback, and control
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Low Overhead}
&
Do not consume storage, bandwidth, or compute time wastefully, allow
system to be [de]activated dynamically
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Low Intrusion}
&
API calls should return rapidly, and users have means to exercise
control of storage vs. transport timing trade-offs
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Responsive}
&
Timeliness of replies should support application steering and global
state interrogation
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Can Dedicate Resources}
&
When available, make use of dedicated resources to avoid contention
\\

\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{On-line Interactivity}
&
Handle control and introspection messages and replies while
workflow is running and SOS is continuously operating
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{User-space}
&
Do not require administrative privileges for basic functionality
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Database}
&
Provide general-purpose SQL query access to data, and utilize
database technology internally
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{HPC-friendly}
&
Take advantage of high-speed communication fabric unique to the
HPC environment.  Do not require components that are not suitable or
available for HPC
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Extensible}
&
Modular design and APIs to allow feature extension, configurable
behavior
\\
%
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{Global Information Space}
&
All information is contextualized and distinctly addressable, even
if not migrated off-node at run-time
\\
