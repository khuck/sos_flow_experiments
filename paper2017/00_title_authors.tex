\begin{abstract} %------------------------------------------------------------%
SOSflow provides a flexible, scalable, and programmable framework for
observation, introspection, feedback, and control of HPC
applications.
%
The Scalable Observation System (SOS) performance model used by SOSflow
allows a broad set of online and in situ capabilities including remote
method invocation, data analysis, and visualization.
%
SOSflow can couple together multiple sources of data, such as application
components and operating environment measures, with multiple software
libraries and performance tools, efficiently creating holistic views of
performance at runtime.
%
SOSflow can can extend the functionality of HPC applications by connecting
and coordinating accessory components, such as in situ visualization tools
that are activated only when the primary application is not performing its
work.
%
This paper describes the use of SOSflow to provide application-focused
monitoring, feedback, and control.
